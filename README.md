# GRhOOT-Ontology
GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of rhetorical figures in the German language.
It contains the formal description of 108 rhetorical figures that exist in the German language and also shows examples for every figure. It is described in the file ```ghroot.owl```.

The file ```competency-questions.txt``` shows five competency questions in DL and SPARQL that were used to perform a completeness check on the ontology. \
An example how to use SPARQL in Python can be found in the file ```Python_SPARQL.py```.

The ontology is available at: https://ramonakuehn.de/grhoot.owl \
A documentation created with LODE is available at: https://ramonakuehn.de/grhoot_documentation.htm
